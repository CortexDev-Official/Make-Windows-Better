## 🛠️ The MWB Toolset (Technical Selection)
I have handpicked these built-in features based on resource footprint, reliability, and functionality.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Package Management** | [100+ App Hub] | A curated GUI for Winget. Batch installs browsers, dev tools, and games without manual installers. |
| **System Repair** | [Integrity Suite] | Uses SFC and DISM to repair corrupted system files and restore Windows health instantly. |
| **Performance** | [Gaming Mode] | ctivates the Ultimate Performance power plan and reduces background latency for heavy tasks. |
| **Network** | [Network Flush] | Clears DNS cache and resets the network stack to fix connectivity lag and latency issues. |
| **Maintenance** | [Deep Cleaner] | Targets system junk, temporary files, and app cache that standard tools often miss. |
