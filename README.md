🚀 Make My Windows Better (MWB)

Curated by CortexDev-Official Windows, redefined. Optimized for privacy, speed, and clean workflows.
📜 Project Legacy & Continuity

    [!NOTE] This project is the official successor to my previous system optimization scripts. MWB is now the central home for all Windows enhancement tools developed by CortexDev. This is the only active and verified home for MWB.

🛡️ Privacy & Security (False Positives)

    [!TIP] Modern antivirus engines often flag Python-based executables. This project is Open Source to ensure 100% transparency.

    [VirusTotal Notice] 🛡️

        The Logic: If you see detections like Wacatac.B!ml, they are False Positives. Since the app is packaged with PyInstaller and isn't digitally signed, AI scanners flag it. Check the source code to verify.

    [Admin Rights] 🔒

        The Logic: MWB requires Administrator privileges to modify power plans, flush DNS, and install software via Winget. This is necessary for the tools to function correctly.

🛠️ The MWB Toolset (Technical Selection)

I have handpicked these built-in features based on resource footprint, reliability, and functionality.
Category	Tool	Why it makes the cut
Package Management	100+ App Hub	A curated GUI for Winget. Batch installs browsers, dev tools, and games without manual installers.
System Repair	Integrity Suite	Uses SFC and DISM to repair corrupted system files and restore Windows health instantly.
Performance	Gaming Mode	Activates the Ultimate Performance power plan and reduces background latency for heavy tasks.
Network	Network Flush	Clears DNS cache and resets the network stack to fix connectivity lag and latency issues.
Maintenance	Deep Cleaner	Targets system junk, temporary files, and app cache that standard tools often miss.
