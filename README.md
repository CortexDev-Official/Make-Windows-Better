Windows, but better. it's "Make My Windows Better" "MWB" Curated by CortexDev-Official
🚀 Make My Windows Better (MWB)Official Utility by CortexDev-OfficialWindows, redefined. Optimized for privacy, speed, and clean workflows.📜 Project Continuity & Vision[!NOTE]This project is the official successor to my previous system optimization scripts. MWB is now the central home for all Windows enhancement tools developed by CortexDev.MWB is not just a tool; it's the bridge between a fresh, bloated Windows installation and a fully optimized powerhouse. We aim to centralize everything from package management to deep system repairs into one "Cyber-Glass" dashboard.🛡️ Security & VirusTotal Notice[!IMPORTANT]Some antivirus engines (including VirusTotal) may flag the MWB_CortexDev.exe file. These are 100% FALSE POSITIVES.The Logic: MWB is written in Python and converted to EXE via PyInstaller. This process creates a self-extracting archive that many AI-based scanners flag because they cannot inspect the package.Administrative Rights: Since MWB modifies power plans and installs software, it requires "Admin" rights. Scanners like McAfee or SecureAge automatically label this behavior as "Suspicious" without looking at the actual code.Verification: This project is Open Source. You are invited to review main.py yourself or run the script using Python directly if you have any concerns.🛠️ The MWB Core ToolsetI have integrated these features into the dashboard based on resource footprint and reliability.CategoryFunctionalityWhy it makes the cutPackage Management100+ App HubUses Microsoft Winget to batch install Browsers, Dev Tools, and Media apps without manual installers.System RepairIntegrity SuiteOne-click SFC and DISM repairs to fix corrupted Windows system files instantly.PerformanceGaming ModeUnlocks the hidden Ultimate Performance Power Plan and reduces background latency for gamers.NetworkDNS & IP FlushInstantly resets your network stack and clears DNS lag for a smoother browsing experience.StorageDeep CleaningTargets hidden system junk and temporary files that the standard "Disk Cleanup" misses.📥 Installation & Usage[!TIP]Always run the application as Administrator to ensure all optimization scripts can execute correctly.Download the latest release from the [Releases] tab.Launch MWB_CortexDev.exe.Navigate through the Sidebar to optimize your system.🤝 Community & FeedbackIf you encounter any issues, such as a TclError or UI glitches, please open an Issue on this repository.
