## 📜 Project Legacy & Continuity
> [!NOTE]
> This project was originally hosted under **StrykeDev-Official**. Due to a suspension on the previous account, I have moved the entire repository here. This is the only active and verified home for MWB.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security (The Essentials)
> [!TIP]
> Modern Windows telemetry is aggressive. These two tools are your first line of defense.

* **[Zen Browser](https://www.zen-browser.app/)** 🌐
    * **The Logic:** Stop using Microsoft Edge or Chrome. Zen is the ultimate choice for a secure and modern browsing experience. It offers a vertical-tab, performance-first engine without the Google/Microsoft tracking.
* **[Simplewall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall)** 🔒
    * **The Logic:** A simple WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) interface. It doesn't bloat your system like "Antivirus" firewalls; it just blocks unauthorized outgoing connections instantly.

## 🛠️ The MWB Toolset (Technical Selection)
I have handpicked these tools based on resource footprint, reliability, and functionality.

| Category | Tool | Why it makes the cut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Package Management** | [UniGetUI](https://github.com/MartiCliment/UniGetUI) | An essential GUI for Winget/Scoop. Batch updates everything without manual installers. |
| **Workflow / Capture** | [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) | Forget Snipping Tool. ShareX handles OCR, screen recording, and instant uploads with zero friction. |
| **Boot Control** | [AutoRuns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) | The most comprehensive startup monitor. Identifies and disables hidden persistent entries that Task Manager misses. |
| **Archiver** | [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) | Open-source heavy lifter. Superior compression ratio and zero unnecessary background processes compared to WinRAR. |
| **Image Engine** | [ImageGlass](https://imageglass.org/) | Replaces the heavy "Photos" app. It supports HDR and RAW formats with near-instant loading times. |
| **Universal Media** | [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/) | The industry standard. Codec-independent and handles hardware acceleration better than "Movies & TV". |
| **Indexing/Search** | [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) | Real-time DB indexing. Finds any file on a multi-terabyte drive in milliseconds. |
| **Code / Text** | [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) | Ultra-low RAM usage. Essential for config file editing and quick syntax highlighting. |
| **Deep Cleaning** | [BleachBit](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit) | Goes where Disk Cleanup won't. Shreds temporary files and vacuums app databases. |
